`pv-migrate` is a CLI tool/kubectl plugin to easily migrate 
the contents of one Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` to another.

## Demo

## Introduction

On Kubernetes, if you need to rename a resource (like a `Deployment`) or to move it to a different namespace, 
you can simply create a copy of its manifest with the new namespace and/or name and apply it.

However, it is not as simple with `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources: They are not only metadata,
but they also store data in the underlying storage backend.

In these cases, moving the data stored in the PVC can become a problem, making migrations more difficult.

## Use Cases

:arrow_right: You have a database that has a PersistentVolumeClaim `db-data` of size `50Gi`.  
Your DB grew over time, and you need more space for it.  
You cannot resize the PVC because it doesn't support [volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/).  
Simply create a new, bigger PVC `db-data-v2` and use `pv-migrate` to copy data from `db-data` to `db-data-v2`.


:arrow_right: You need to move PersistentVolumeClaim `my-pvc`  from namespace `ns-a` to namespace `ns-b`.  
Simply create the PVC with the same name and manifest in `ns-b` and use `pv-migrate` to copy its content.


:arrow_right: You are moving from one cloud provider to another, 
and you need to move the data from one Kubernetes cluster to the other.  
Just use `pv-migrate` to copy the data **securely over the internet**.

:arrow_right: You want to change the StorageClass of a volume from a 
class that only supports ReadWriteOnce and you need it be capable of 
ReadWriteMany. You want to change the StorageClass from a class that 
stores data locally on a node (e.g., local-path) to one that stores 
the data on the network (e.g., NFS). There is no native automatic way 
to change the StorageClass of a volume, nor can it be changed in-place. 
You can use `pv-migrate` to migrate from your PVC to a new one with the 
desired StorageClass.

## Highlights

- Supports in-namespace, in-cluster as well as cross-cluster migrations
- Uses rsync over SSH with a freshly generated [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) 
  or RSA keys each time to securely migrate the files
- Allows full customization of the manifests (e.g. specifying your own docker images for rsync and sshd, configuring affinity etc.)
- Supports multiple migration strategies to do the migration efficiently and fallback to other strategies when needed
- Customizable strategy order
- Supports arm32v7 (Raspberry Pi etc.) and arm64 architectures as well as amd64
- Supports completion for popular shells: bash, zsh, fish, powershell

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for various installation methods and shell completion configuration.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the CLI reference and examples.
